# The master images follow the normal numbering scheme in which the
# major version is used as the directory name and incorporated into
# the image name (jenkins-2-centos7 in this case).  For the slave
# images we are not versioning them (they actually pull their
# jars from the jenkins master, so they don't have a jenkins version,
# so the only thing we'd version is the maven/nodejs version).
# Since these are basically samples we are just going to maintain one
# version (at least that is the initial goal).  This naming system
# can be revisited in the future if we decide we need either jenkins
# or <platform> version numbers in the names.
